# matlab_limit_surface

MATLAB lib to numerically compute the Limit Surface (LS)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You need MATLAB速 and a supported GPU to run this code. The LS is generated by computing integrals on the GPU.

To see the available GPU device on your system use

```octave
gpuDevice
```

in the MATLAB速 command window.

### Installing

To install the library you just need to add the LS_lib folder to your Matlab path

```octave
addpath('..path_to../LS_lib/')
```
